* nx-secure-connection-indicator:

Secure connection indicator on the left of the URL.

* Installation

Git-clone the repository to your Nyxt extension directory. This
directory is typically located at =~/.local/share/nyxt/extensions=
#+begin_src sh
  git clone ??? ~/.local/share/nyxt/extensions/nx-secure-connection-indicator
#+end_src

After you've added nx-secure-connection-indicator to a place that Nyxt can find it, it is
necessary to load it in your init file. To do this, it suffices to add
the following:

#+NAME: add nx-fruit to init
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
;#+nyxt-3
  (nyxt:define-nyxt-user-system-and-load "nyxt-user/nx-secure-connection-indicator-proxy"
    :description "This proxy system saves us if nx-secure-connection-indicator fails to load.
  Otherwise it will break all the config loading."
    :depends-on ("nx-secure-connection-indicator"))
#+END_SRC

Now, upon starting Nyxt, the glory of the secure connection indicator shall be yours! enjoy.
