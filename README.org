* nx-secure-connection-indicator:

Secure connection indicator on the left of the URL.


* How it works
This extension uses the WebKit browser engine to determine if a given website has a secure connection. If the connection is of type HTTPS but the certificate is invalid, you can see an HTTPS error flag when hovering over the connection status indicator. More information about invalid certificate flag can be found at this link: https://api.gtkd.org/gio.c.types.GTlsCertificateFlags.html.

* Showcase

secure connection [S] example:

#+ATTR_HTML: :style margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;
[[./secure-example.png]]

* Installation

Git-clone the repository to your Nyxt extension directory. This
directory is typically located at =~/.local/share/nyxt/extensions=
#+begin_src sh
  git clone ??? ~/.local/share/nyxt/extensions/nx-secure-connection-indicator
#+end_src

After you've added nx-secure-connection-indicator to a place that Nyxt can find it, it is
necessary to load it in your init file. To do this, it suffices to add
the following:

#+NAME: add nx-fruit to init
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
;#+nyxt-3
(define-configuration status-buffer
  ((style (str:concat %slot-value%
                      (theme:themed-css (theme *browser*)
                        ;; See the `describe-class' of `status-buffer' to
                        ;; understand what to customize
                        '("#controls"
                          :flex-basis "110px"
                          ))))))


(nyxt:define-nyxt-user-system-and-load "nyxt-user/nx-secure-connection-indicator-proxy"
    :description "This proxy system saves us if nx-secure-connection-indicator fails to load.
  Otherwise it will break all the config loading."
    :depends-on ("nx-secure-connection-indicator"))

#+END_SRC

Now, upon starting Nyxt, the glory of the secure connection indicator shall be yours! enjoy.
